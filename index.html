<h2>Rohan Chitnis</h2>
I am a PhD student in <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu" target="_blank">MIT EECS</a>, within <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu" target="_blank">CSAIL</a>'s <a href="http://lis.csail.mit.edu" target="_blank">Learning and Intelligent Systems</a> group. In May 2018, I received an MS in EECS from MIT. In May 2016, I received a BS in EECS, with Highest Honors, from <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>.

<p>I work in the field of artificial intelligence for robotics. My current interests are in probabilistic inference, planning, and learning for human-robot interactive settings involving partial observability. Previously, I have worked at the intersection of task and motion planning (TAMP) and reinforcement learning. Please check out my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> if you would like to learn more.

<p>I have enjoyed being a <a href="teaching.html">Teaching Assistant</a> numerous times throughout my academic career, and hope to continue in the future.

<p><b>News:</b><br>
In Summer 2017, I did a research internship with <a href="https://research.google.com/teams/brain/robotics/" target="_blank">Google Brain Robotics</a>, working on methods for improving exploration in deep reinforcement learning.</p>

In Summer 2016, I interned as a software engineer at Airbnb, doing machine learning with the Search Ranking team.</p>

<p>In March 2016, I was awarded an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org" target="_blank">NSF GRFP Fellowship</a> (<i>accepted</i>) and an <a href="https://ndseg.asee.org/" target="_blank">NDSEG Fellowship</a> (<i>declined</i>).</p>

<p>In January 2016, I was selected as one of 40 <b>Finalists</b> for the <a href="http://hertzfoundation.org" target="_blank">Hertz Fellowship</a>, a highly reputable fellowship for student researchers in the physical, biological, and engineering sciences.</p>

<p>In December 2015, I was selected as the <b>Runner-up</b> for the <a href="http://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/#2016" target="_blank">2016 Computing Research Association (CRA) Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award</a> (Male, PhD-granting institution).</p>
