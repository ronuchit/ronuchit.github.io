<h2>Rohan Chitnis</h2>
I am a fourth-year undergraduate at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a> in the department of <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences</a>.
<br>
<p>I was recently selected as the <b>Runner-up</b> for the <a href="http://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/#2016" target="_blank">2016 Computing Research Association (CRA) Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award</a> (Male, PhD-granting institution)!</p>

<p>I conduct research primarily in robotics/AI, with <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel" target="_blank">Professor Pieter Abbeel</a>'s Robot Learning Lab. My main interests are in hierarchical planning, which seeks to get robots to execute tasks that require a long sequence of steps, like setting a dinner table. I have recently been exploring reinforcement learning techniques for improving the performance of hierarchical planning systems. Check out my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> for more information.</p>

<p>I also dabble in NLP (Natural Language Processing). I've done some <a href="publications.html">work</a> in neural machine translation with <a href="http://www.denero.org" target="_blank">John DeNero</a> as part of the <a href="http://oscii.org" target="_blank">Oscii Lab</a>.</p>

I've taken some advanced classes and participated in a couple of hackathons, so I've got a few interesting <a href="projects.html">projects</a> you can check out.

<p>I enjoy <a href="teaching.html">being a TA</a> for CS classes. The culture of collaboration in the Berkeley CS community is one of my favorite aspects of being a student, and I'm happy to be doing my part. I've thus far been a TA for courses on introductory computer science, computer architecture, and artificial intelligence. Next semester, I'm excited to be a TA for the course on machine learning!</p>

<p>My primary hobby and source of stress relief is running. I ran my fifth half-marathon in September 2015. I also enjoy reading. Here are some <a href="reading.html">good books</a>.</p>
