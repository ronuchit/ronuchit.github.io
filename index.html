<h2>Rohan Chitnis</h2>
I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a> in the department of <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences</a>.
<br>
<p>I conduct research primarily in robotics, with <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel" target="_blank">Professor Pieter Abbeel</a>'s Robot Learning Lab. My main interests are in hierarchical planning, which seeks to get robots to execute tasks that require a long sequence of steps, like setting a dinner table. I have recently been exploring reinforcement learning techniques for improving the performance of hierarchical planning systems. Check out my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> for more information.</p>

<p>I also dabble in NLP (Natural Language Processing), and I've done some work in neural machine translation with <a href="http://www.denero.org" target="_blank">John Denero</a> as part of the <a href="http://oscii.org" target="_blank">Oscii Lab</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoy <a href="teaching.html">being a TA</a> for classes. Helping people feels good.</p>

<p>My primary hobby and source of stress relief is running. A really cool person I recently met also helped me get into reading. Here are some <a href="reading.html">good books</a>.</p>
