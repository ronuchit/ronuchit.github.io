<h2>Interesting Class Projects</h2>
<b><a href="https://github.com/alancyao/dynamic-viewing" target="_blank">Dynamic Viewing</a> (1st place)</b><br>
For CSUA Hackathon Spring 2015, we built our final project for CS280, Computer Vision. We developed an algorithm to quickly track a user's face position, rotation, and distance using pyramid SSD template matching. Based on the tracking, we dynamically alter the center of projection of the monitor screen to offer a more realistic viewing experience.<br>

Webpages showing all my work for CS194-26, Computational Photography and Image Manipulation. This was one of my favorite classes in Berkeley; the projects were simply amazing and eye-opening to the power of algorithmic image processing.<br><br>

My personal webpage for CS184, Computer Graphics. It showcases results for all my class projects.<br><br>

<h2>Interesting Side Projects</h2>
<b><a href="https://github.com/ronuchit/ChessDetectorMoveFinder" target="_blank">ChessDetectorMoveFinder</a> (1st place)</b><br>
For CSUA Hackathon Fall 2015, we built a system that takes as input a running video stream of your real-life chess game through an Asus PrimeSense. It passes the board state after each turn to Stockfish, which then speaks out the optimal move for that turn.<br><br>

<b><a href="https://github.com/ronuchit/Hands-on-HTML" target="_blank">Hands-on HTML</a></b><br>
For Big Hack Spring 2014, we wrote a program that accepts as input a picture (drawn on paper) and turns it into an HTML webpage. The service renders images, recognizes text, and preserves locations of webpage components. Then, hand gestures can be used to dynamically shift, scale, and rotate the elements of the webpage.<br><br>

<b><a href="https://github.com/ronuchit/spaceface" target="_blank">Spaceface</a></b><br>
For Caltech's Hacktech Spring 2014, we created an online multiplayer 3D space shooter game controlled with facial motions: head-turning to navigate and blinking to shoot!<br><br>

<b><a href="https://github.com/ronuchit/CrosswordDetectorSolver" target="_blank">CrosswordDetectorSolver</a> (1st place)</b><br>
For CSUA Hackathon Fall 2013, we built a system that takes as input a picture of a crossword puzzle and its clues, and outputs the complete solved puzzle.<br><br>

<b><a href="https://github.com/ronuchit/AccelerometerMaze" target="_blank">Accelerometer Maze</a></b><br>
For H@B Bearhack Fall 2013, we wrote an Android phone accelerometer-based maze navigation game, played on the computer.
