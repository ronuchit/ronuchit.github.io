<h2>Some Books You Should Read</h2>

<b>Angels & Demons</b>, Dan Brown.</b><br>
Amazing work of fiction that really gets at the core of the science vs. religion debate. It is also a gripping action/thriller novel.
<br><br>

<b>The Power of Habit</b>, Charles Duhigg.</b><br>
Everyone should understand the neurological basis of habits. This book explains how we can build new habits and change old ones, at the personal, business, and societal level. As it turns out, habits can pretty much be modeled using MDPs (then again, so can anything that's fully observed).
